# Workflow

We follow: Idea → Spec → Plan → Approval → Build → PR → Preview → Ship.

Rules:
- Do not edit or write source code until /approve has been run and approval is active.
- Always work on a feature branch (never commit on main/master).
- For changes: run /spec, then /plan, then ask for explicit approval, then implement.
- Use /pr to open a PR with a clean summary.
