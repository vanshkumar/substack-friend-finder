description: Convert spec into an implementation plan (PRD-style)
---
Using the current SPEC (ask me to paste it if missing), produce a plan with:
- Proposed approach
- File-level change list (what files, what edits)
- Test plan
- Rollout/preview plan
- “Definition of done”
End by asking: “Approve? (yes/no)”
